# October 22nd 2025 Team 3 Meeting Notes with Chad Poloni

**Agenda:**
- Review new potential research question:
  - How do dietary fibre intake and exercise affect cardiometabolic health, and does this correspond with unique microbiome profiles?
- Review experimental aims and rationale:
  - Analyze the relationship between dietary fibre intake, cardiometabolic health, and distinct microbial profiles
  - Compare the diversity metrics of groups with adequate and inadequate dietary fibre intake and exercise
  - Investigate the effects of dietary fibre intake on indicators of poor cardiometabolic health, including high LDL-cholesterol and low adiponectin
  - Identify unique microbial taxa associated with the indicators of poor cardiometabolic health
- What methods should we use to address each of these aims?

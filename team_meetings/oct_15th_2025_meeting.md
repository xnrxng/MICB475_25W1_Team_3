# October 15th 2025 Team 3 Meeting Notes with Chad Poloni

**Agenda:**
- Discussing our chosen "healthy diet": percentage of carbs, fibre, protein, fat, which fats are being consumed (cholesterol, TAGs), LDL, HDL, BMI, weight, (not including calories?)
- Discussing our specific research question(s). Some potential options are:
 1.
  
- Columns of the metadata
 1. Adiponectin: a hormone from fat tissue that helps with insulin sensitivity and inflammation, and affects metabolic processes like fatty acid breakdown and regulating glucose levels.
 2. Diastolic bp: diastolic blood pressure is the bottom number in a blood pressure reading, representing the pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. High diastolic pressure can indicate increased pressure in your arteries and may be linked to serious health complications if left unmanaged. A healthy diastolic reading is typically less than 80 mm Hg.
 3. Hemoglobin a1c: a Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test is a blood test measuring your average blood sugar (glucose) over the past two to three months by checking the amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin in your red blood cells. It's used to diagnose and monitor prediabetes and diabetes, with results reported as a percentage. A normal A1c is typically below 5.7%, while 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes, and 6.5% or higher suggests diabetes.
 4. CRP: short for C-reactive protein, a protein produced by the liver that indicates the presence of inflammation in the body. A CRP test is a blood test used to measure levels of this protein to help detect and monitor infections, inflammatory diseases, and tissue damage.

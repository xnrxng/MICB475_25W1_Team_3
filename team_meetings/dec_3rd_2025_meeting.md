# December 3rd 2025 Team 3 Meeting Notes with Chad Poloni

**Agenda:**

-   Discuss network analysis results.
-   Potentially discuss how LASSO fits into our story/manuscript.
-   Discuss research done from PICRUST and DESEQ results.
-   Discuss team 4's presentation.

**Meeting notes:**
- Good and bad species being upregulated and downregulated, how do we explain that? Look at specific species or genuses within the families and talk about it that way rather than the whole family. If that doesn’t work either, we can say that it’s a confounding factor and that fibre doesn’t rescue it
- Lach…increased in healthy CV status and decreased in the abnormal CV status in exercise (in our data) but in the previous paper, it was shown to increase in the abnormal CV condition. Can talk about how we broke it down differently from them (so that’s how we can justify it).
- Metabolic pathways that are decreased in both statuses…Could be positive or negative things within those ontologies sooo it might not be a specific thing. Don't over-extrapolate and maybe mention it as a limiting factor. If you want to compare, go into specifics with the pathways
- Lasso: include in supplemental. Just say when we ran all variables from the metadata it’s not predictive but we wanted to see if it can rescue with exercise.
- For networks: focus on connectors and look into what taxa they are. 
- Also networks: make one large figure with multiple panels. Have the two modules at the top, two nodes in the middle and then heatmaps at the bottom (healthy and abnormal in each row so 6 panels overall). Main takeaway: more connectors in abnormal than in healthy. Make it and send it to Chad to get his feedback.
- Send a draft manuscript to Chad by Dec 13th morning latest to get overall feedback.
- Houria will work on the merging/creating of manuscript figures. Rui please send example

**To do:**
- Make the networks graph and send it to Chad to get his feedback.
- Send the draft manuscript to Chad by Dec 13th morning latest to get his feedback.
- Houria will work on the merging/creating of manuscript figures. Rui please send an example to her

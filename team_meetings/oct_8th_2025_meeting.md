# October 8th 2025 Team 3 Meeting Notes with Chad Poloni

**Agenda:**
- Discuss the main idea of the project, which is the merging of the westernization dataset and the new depression dataset.
- Discuss how to merge these datasets (normalization, meta-analysis) and the disadvantages and the benefits.
- Where is the new depression dataset and its metadata? Does the depression dataset have annotated exercise levels (specifically METS per week)?
- Research questions:
  1. How does exercise impact the microbiome and in turn, how does it relate to depression?
     - Diversity between conditions: alpha and beta diversity
     - Bacteria that differ among conditions: differential abundance testing
     - Bacteria that tend to appear together: networks
     - The difference in functionality across conditions: PICRUSt
  2. Which attributes can explain bacterial diversity? Are we able to build an ML algorithm to predict 1) bacterial diversity or 2) condition?
  
**To do:**

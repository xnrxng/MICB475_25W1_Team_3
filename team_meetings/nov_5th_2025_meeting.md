# November 5th 2025 Team 3 Meeting Notes with Chad Poloni

**Agenda:**

- Discuss Aim 1 results
- Discuss normalization/transformation methods
- Usage of a colorblind palette and "paper-ready" figures
. Remove age_range for RDA?
- Use Group LASSO or drop categorical variables?
- Lab notebook format?
- Updates on aims 2/3?
- Proposal feedback approximate return date?
- Post-analysis work/writing/final presentation?

**Meeting notes:**
- Can use the feedback we get on the proposal for when writing our paper (for ex: some people use the same intro or experimental aims section)
- Add the correlation method/scale for the heat map
- For the heatmap: put stars for the cells that are significant. See if these phylum are implicated in cardiometabolic status 
- Look into the phyla (in the literature) to see if they’re associated with cardiovascular disease and if they fit the story then include them but otherwise don’t
- Do rda and then permanova: run adonis2 only including the terms from the rda that were significant
- Remove age_range from RDA
- Even though fibre changes microbiome it doesn't rescue cardiovascular disease
- For the lasso: can just stick with dropping the categorical variables and mention in the paper that it doesn’t handle categorical variables well so that’s why we did that
- Can say even tho fibre changes the microbiome but doesn’t rescue cardiovascular disease (so just say what we see). Can also add in exercise results once we have those (maybe that’ll be significant, maybe it won’t be)
- Only include the testing ROC on the plot
- Change title of roc curve
- What other plots or tables should be made for aim 1? Include all the data as tables, as p values. Be cautious with including the high and low confidence intervals. Delete the intercept.
- Hypothesis testing: remove high and low 
- For plots, both png and svg are fine. We’d put the plots in the paper or presentation (which we’d submit as a pdf)
- Confidence intervals - just p value and standard error. Delete the intercept

**To do:**
- Finish aims 1, 2 and 3.
- Start preparing slides.
- Start manuscript writing.

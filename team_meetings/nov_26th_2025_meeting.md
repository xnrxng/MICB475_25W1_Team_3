# November 26th 2025 Team 3 Meeting Notes with Chad Poloni

**Agenda:**

-   Discuss DRAFT slides.
-   Discuss Picrust2 results.
-   What is an appropriate title? What is our story?

**Meeting notes:**
- In our manuscript, we can make it clear that there was quite a bit of significance (aim4 05 plot), so that’s why we chose a pretty strict p-value and log fold cut-off to reduce it. Can elaborate on it in the manuscript but in the presentation maybe not cause it’s too short.
- Look up what KO term the infectious disease one is (aim4 05 plot) and maybe explain it more in the manuscript to really build our case.
- (aim4 05 plot again) Healthy profile is expected which is good. For the abnormal one, pathogenic behaviours are reduced when they exercise and eat more fibre so really good also (so it's becoming a healthier phenotype)
- For alpha diversity, it’s better to do a linear model than Kruskal-Wallis???
- Can connect the bugs seen in deseq (06) to our functional results AND individual microbe levels (just not at the community level). Fibre and exercise are known to be good for CV so build on that
- Family level over phylum level!
- How do we integrate lasso? Look up papers that have lasso and see how they’ve presented it. Show some sort of an importance table (top 10 or something). Show the model and how accurate it is (83%, good!!!) and explain that our variable just weren’t the significant ones
- Don’t need to have lasso in our presentation (other team could get confused)
- What figures to put in the presentation/manuscript: 
    - 00: supplementary figure S1
    - 04: supplementary table S1. Only include the significant variables in the table (explain why we controlled for our specific confounding variables)
    - Aim2, alpha 06 (Faiths PD): figure 2 panel a
    - Aim2, alpha (Shannons): figure2 panel b
    - Aim2, beta (Bray Curtis): figure 3
    - Aim3, deseq 06: figure 4
    - Volcano plot for deseq supplementary figure S2
    - Aim4, piecrust 05: figure 5 
    - Lasso aim1 (09?) should be figure 6?
    - Aim0 07 figure 1* in the methods section (only the bottom histograms but not the age one)
    - Post-meeting discussion with Rui: Package used for networks: microreco. Need to do a bit more research on the functions the specific phyla serve (but many overlap with deseq). Exercise was significantly associated with modality (smaller communities within the bigger gut microbiome that work together?)

**To do:**

# November 19th 2025 Team 3 Meeting Notes with Chad Poloni

**Agenda:**

- Discuss Aim 2 results -> alpha diversity, preliminary beta diversity
- Discuss Aim 3 results, LASSO and DESeq
- Can re-discuss aim 1 new results

**Meeting notes:**
- Should we separate cities and then run RDA on them separately? Discuss further.
- Run functional assays? Since we still have time...It doesn’t run on our server so ask Avril (give him the code) to run it on a different server for us.
- g_Incertae-S... means unknown in Latin. Try to work our way backwards to find the families? Or remove idk (change to NA to see family instead).
- Over or under-represented rather than down or up-regulated (change graph legend).
- Try Shannon’s for alpha diversity to get more representation of diversity matrices (on top of Faith's PD).
- Do the deseq2 (06 in aim3) for fibre and exercise too (cause rn it’s only done for CV status). The main point of the project is fibre and exercise so that’s what we want to show (4 graphs for low/high exercise and then low/high fibre).
- Be aware when making our presentation, cause other teams might not immediately understand and be confused with the graphs. Make the presentation really simple if you can. Maybe meet with the team that’s presenting our data beforehand to chat and answer their questions. Module 17 should help out.
- Presentation dates come out this Friday.
- Come with a draft of our presentation next meeting.

**To do:**
- First draft of presentation.
- Continue to work on the analysis (Shannon's for alpha diversity. Beta diversity. Deseq. Functional assays. etc?)
